# Linear and Nonlinear Optimization

This repo contains the Optimization Coding I did in the fall 2022 semester. 
Here's brief rundown of topics covered: 

# Unconstrained

Least-Squares, Regularized Least-Squares, Newton's Method, Convergence of NM, Secant Method, Gradient Descent (Steepest Descent), Optimality and Convexity, Linear Search Methods, Quasi-Newton

# Constrained 

Linear Programming, Feasibility, KKT, Langrangian Duality, Simplex Method, Interior-Point Method, Quadratic Programming
